# patchanalysis
MATLAB scripts for patch-clamp data analysis.

This collection includes two scripts: CellCharFun.m and sPSCcorr.m

CellCharFun.m is used for analysing passive and active neuronal properties from current injection recordings. An example file is included.

sPSCcorr.m is used for detection and analysis of spontaneous PSC events correlated between channels in multicellular patch-clamp data.

These scripts have been written for analysis of recording files with specific structure, and are not intended for immediate general application.
I hope that you find them helpful as a basis for your own analysis, but please ensure all parameters and analyses are correct and appropriate for your own data structure.
Detailed information on the limitations and assumptions of each script is included in the header of the .m file.

These scripts were written for Watson et al. Cell Reports 2025. [BioRxiv](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2024.06.24.600436v1)
