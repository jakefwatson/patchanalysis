# patchanalysis
MATLAB scripts for patch clamp data analysis
This collection includes two scripts: CellCharFun and sPSCcorr

This code has been written for analysis of recording files with specific structure, and is not intended as a general analysis script.
I hope that you find it helpful as a basis for your own analysis, but please ensure all parameters and analyses are  correct and appropriate for your own data structure.
Detailed information on the limitations and assumptions of each script is included in the header of the .m file.
